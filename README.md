# Analytics Kickstart Projects in Fort Lauderdale, FL

The Center for Government Excellence (GovEx) collaborated with the City of Fort Lauderdale, FL on two fronts:
* Understanding of the demand for Fire Rescue Services
* Assessing public safety as a function of street lighting

## Understanding the Demand for Fire Rescue Services 

### Data
The project team used data from the 911 call center and dispatch data, as well as publicly-available data on demographics, transportation and tourism. 
* [Permanent Population](www.bebr.ufl.edu/population/data)
* [Tourist Population: Broward County Convention and Visitors Bureau](http://sunny.org/vital-stats/)
* [Commuter Population: American Community Survey](http://onthemap.ces.census.gov/)
* Snowbird Population: American Community Survey: [Here](http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_1YR/S1101/1600000US1224000) and [Here](http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_1YR/B25004/1600000US1224000)

### Training Materials
The team conducted an on-site 3-day training for staff in the City Manager’s office, IT Dept. and the Fire Dept. to map the intake and dispatch process, analyze trends, and identify key drivers of call volumes. The team also looked at the relationships between demand for fire services and other variables, like: population, tourism, occupancy,and demand for other city services. All of the training materials are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IfwyClQRiI6h2iRpG61binkWdw03AGsrcsarV0HP3IM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Assessing Public Safety as a Function of Street Lighting

### Data
[GIS Data for Broward County](http://gis.broward.org/GISData.htm) contains information about Fort Lauderdale’s city boundaries, state roads, and Broward County address points.

Locations of streetlights, Fort Lauderdale Neighbor Surveys (2012 - 2015), and public safety data were provided by the city, insofar as they were able. Public safety data in particular was sent as password-protected Excel files in an abundance of caution over personally identifiable information (PII). Analysis done using web-based CARTO was also protected using CARTO’s built-in privacy tools.
